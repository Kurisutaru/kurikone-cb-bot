# Kurikone Clan-Battle Discord Bot

A Discord bot designed to assist clans in managing their clan battles in *Princess Connect! Re:Dive*. This bot helps track boss health, player bookings, damage entries, and battle progress within a Discord server. It creates dedicated channels for each boss, provides interactive buttons for booking and submitting entries, and uses MariaDB to store battle data persistently.

It took almost same with the existing Japanese Bot 「アオイたん」 by T-niNe, I just recreate it to add some feature (especially the input validation because some peeps doing peeps things) and with English Language.
Btw this is My First (from zero) project using python (I'm your regular backend guy with C#), so point Me to right direction if My code weird as hell.

You can see my figma prototype at [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/C1qiBAUNZNNeChsM1usGzk/Discord---Purikone-CB-Bot?node-id=0-1&t=oIsnig840b2wEMJH-1)

## Features

- **Automated Channel Setup**: Creates a category and text channels for reporting and managing up to 5 bosses, plus a "TL Shifter" channel.
- **Boss Tracking**: Displays boss HP, round number, and status with embedded messages.
- **Player Interaction**:
  - Book a slot to attack a boss (Physical or Magic attack types).
  - Submit damage entries (in millions) via a modal form.
  - Mark an attack as "Done" or "Dead" to report leftover time when a boss is defeated.
  - Cancel a booking if needed.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Embeds update in real-time to reflect bookings, completed attacks, and boss HP.
- **Permission Management**: Restricts channel access to ensure only the bot can post updates, while allowing user interaction via buttons and modals.


## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12**: Ensure you have Python 3.12 installed.
- **Discord Bot Token**: You can get the token by creating bot on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)
- **MariaDB**: A MariaDB database is required for persistent storage.
- **Dependencies**: Install required Python packages (see [Installation](#installation)).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kurisutaru/kurikone-cb-bot.git
   cd princess-connect-clan-battle-bot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required Python packages using `pip`. You’ll need `discord.py` and a MariaDB connector (e.g., `PyMySQL` or `mysql-connector-python`):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   If you’re using a different MariaDB connector, adjust accordingly (e.g., `pip install mysql-connector-python`).

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root by copy and rename the `.env.example`
   - Replace `YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE` with your Discord bot token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
   - Update the `DB_*` variables with your MariaDB connection details.

4. **Set Up MariaDB**:
   - Install MariaDB if not already installed (e.g., `sudo apt install mariadb-server` on Ubuntu).
   - Create a database by run the script on dbscript/script.sql

5. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python -0 main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Invite the Bot**: Add the bot to your Discord server using an invite link generated from the Discord Developer Portal.
2. **Channel Setup**: When the bot joins a server or starts, it automatically creates a category (e.g., "Clan Battle") and channels for reporting, bosses (Boss 1–5), and TL shifting.
3. **Interact with Bosses**: Profit ?

I suggest just read my personal handbook (free of charge) on here [アオイたん Complete BOT Tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K51z0uQQuuUPViHRGTuhmeWVzCb7QO0gOwB72MZnKfY/edit?usp=sharing) or [just see the bot flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/JIOf1ic.png)


## Project Structure
